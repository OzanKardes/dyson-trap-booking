# 🏛️ Dyson Building Booking Tracker

A crowdsourced web app built by Imperial College London students to track room bookings in the Dyson Building — because staff can see when rooms are booked, but we can't.

---

## 🤔 The Problem

The Dyson Building room booking system is only visible to staff. Students have no way of knowing whether a room is free or occupied, leading to wasted trips and frustration. This app fixes that by letting students report bookings they've spotted, building up a shared picture of room availability for everyone.

---

## ✨ Features

- View a live table of reported bookings for the week
- Submit a booking you've spotted in seconds
- Clean, simple interface built in Imperial's navy blue
- No login required — just submit and go
